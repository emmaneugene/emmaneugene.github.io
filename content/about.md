## about me:

Hi! My name is Emmanuel. I've gone by a few nicknames, but most people call me 'Emman'.

I love solving problems, asking hard questions, and tinkering. I'm looking to use my skills to work in high-impact roles tackling challenging engineering problems in an open, collaborative context.

I am an [impatient optimist](https://web.archive.org/web/20230408002619/https://bigthink.com/progress/pessimism-is-a-barrier-to-progress/). I believe that creating a sustainable and equitable future is well within our means, and I want to contribute to it in my lifetime.

I'm interested in building software systems that are robust, scalable, secure and performant, and making those concepts as accessible as possible. To that end, I share my knowledge through writing, teaching, and volunteering opportunities wherever possible.

Some of my interests and hobbies include strength training, DIY, [model kits](https://www.instagram.com/londo_bells/?hl=en), food, jazz, film, and reading.
