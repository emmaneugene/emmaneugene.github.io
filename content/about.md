## about me:

Hi! My name is Emmanuel. I've gone by a few nicknames, but most people call me 'Emman'.

I love solving problems, asking hard questions, and tinkering. I'm looking to use my skills to work in high-impact roles tackling challenging engineering problems in an open, collaborative context.

I am an [impatient optimist](https://web.archive.org/web/20230408002619/https://bigthink.com/progress/pessimism-is-a-barrier-to-progress/). I believe that creating a sustainable and equitable future is well within our means, and I want to contribute to it in my lifetime.

I'm interested in building software systems that are robust, scalable, secure and performant, and making those concepts as accessible as possible. To that end, I share my knowledge through writing, teaching, and volunteering opportunities wherever possible.

While I can't say I have the necessary experience, these are some problem areas I'd like to devote time and/or resources into solving:

**Energy**: Energy powers everything that we do, and our biggest challenge is to provide clean, reliable sources to meet humanity's needs as soon as possible. Renewables like solar and wind are in many cases already cheaper than fossil fuels, but we desperately need innovation in many more areas to get to a future where energy is abundant and carbon-neutral.

**Repair**: Technology is great, but the one thing nobody talks about is what happens when it stops working. Modern appliances have incredibly short shelf lives and are often designed to be [replaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence), with disastrous consequences for the environment. I'm interested in any and all efforts to make DIY and repair more accessible.

**Robotics**: Software on its own is complex, but we've barely scratched the surface in terms of how it can interact with the real world. I believe that [nature-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics) robots will be crucial for us to flourish in a changing world, and it's a space I'd like to learn more about.

**Public health**: Implementing policies that target low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for community-level health outcomes - I believe there's a lot of missed value in quantifying the impact of environmental influences like noise and [air pollution](https://patrickcollison.com/pollution), expanding green spaces (see: [solarpunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U)), and improving nutrition and sleep as pre-emptive health interventions.
