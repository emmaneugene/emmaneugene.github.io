## work:

Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '[How I work](https://den.dev/how-i-work)':

- \- I rapidly prototype and validate ideas, a task which software is [uniquely suited for](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.279.5353.992).

- \- I value clean, concise documentation over tribal knowledge and word-of-mouth.

- \- I strive to respond to every message within 2 working days.

- \- Ask me questions! Give me feedback! As a rule of thumb, I believe every decision is open to criticism.

- \- But also, [don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/).
