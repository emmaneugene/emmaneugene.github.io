## work:

Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '[How I work](https://den.dev/how-i-work)':

- \- I'm a big proponent of prototyping and validating ideas as soon as possible, for which software is [uniquely suited](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.279.5353.992).

- \- If it wasn't obvious by now, I value clean, concise documentation.

- \- I strive to respond to every message within 2 working days.

- \- [Don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/), and don't ask permission for the things you can do yourself

- \- Ask me questions! Give me feedback! As a rule of thumb, I believe every decision is open to criticism.
