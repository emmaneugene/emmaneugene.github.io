## themes:

These are some problem areas I'd like to devote time and/or resources into solving:

**Energy**: Energy powers everything that we do, and our biggest challenge is to provide clean, reliable sources to meet humanity's needs as soon as possible. Renewables like solar and wind are in many cases already cheaper than fossil fuels, but we desperately need innovation in many more areas to get to a future where energy is abundant and carbon-neutral.

**Repair**: Technology is great, but the one thing nobody talks about is what happens when it stops working. Modern appliances have incredibly short shelf lives and are often designed to be [replaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence), with disastrous consequences for the environment. I'm interested in any and all efforts to make DIY and repair more accessible.

**Robotics**: Software on its own is complex, but we've barely scratched the surface in terms of how it can interact with the real world. I believe that [nature-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics) robots will be crucial for us to flourish in a changing world, and it's a space I'd like to learn more about.

**Public health**: Implementing policies that target low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for community-level health outcomes - I believe there's a lot of missed value in quantifying the impact of environmental influences like noise and [air pollution](https://patrickcollison.com/pollution), expanding green spaces (see: [solarpunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U)), and improving nutrition and sleep as pre-emptive health interventions.
