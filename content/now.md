## now

A brief [summary](https://nownownow.com/about) of what's going for me at the moment:

- \- Working as a software engineer on Shopee's Data Infrastructure team.

- \- My goal for this year is to read and work through more foundational textbooks,
  so I joined a [book club](https://eatonphil.com/2026-ostep.html)!

- \- Experimenting heavily with coding agents and tools to get them working at their best -
  Still sticking with Opus for most tasks, but Kimi K2.5 is a very good contender. I'm looking
  forward to more open source models catching up with SOTA and bringing the cost of intelligence
  down even more.
