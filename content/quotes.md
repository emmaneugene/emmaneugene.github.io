## quotes:

As clichéd as they may seem, I think [quotes](http://quotes.cat-v.org/) serve as valuable reminders in daily life. Here are some of my personal favorites (and a small selection of poem snippets):

_"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."_  
— **Muhammad Ali**

_"What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."_  
— **Carlos Castaneda**

_"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being."_  
— **Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe**

_"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction."_

_"Those who bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves."_  
— **J.M. Barrie**

_"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."_  
— **George Bernard Shaw**

_"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all."_  
— **Ecclesiastes 9:11 (KJV)**

_"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one — the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts."_  
— **C.S. Lewis**

_"If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."_  
— **Mary Oliver**

_"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."_  
— **The Secret Life of Walter Mitty**

_"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print."_  
— **Barbara Tuchman**

_"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof."_  
— **John Kenneth Galbraith**

_"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else."_  
— **Charlie Chaplin**

_"I bargained with Life for a penny,  
and Life would pay no more,  
However I begged at evening  
When I counted my scanty store;_

_Life is a just employer.  
He gives you what you ask,  
But once you have set the wages,  
Why, you must bear the task._

_I worked for a menial's hire,  
Only to learn, dismayed,  
That any wage I had asked of Life  
Life would have willingly paid."_  
— **Jessie B. Rittenhouse**

_"There is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average  
Human being to supply any given army on any given day  
And the best at murder are those who preach against it  
And the best at hate are those who preach love  
And the best at war finally are those who preach peace"_  
— **Charles Bukowski: The Genius Of The Crowd**

_"I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path."_  
— **Jiddu Krishnamurti**

_"A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in."_  
— **Greek Proverb**

_"Years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute."_  
— **Edgar Allan Poe**

_"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here."_  
— **Richard Dawkins**

_"Hey, it's our basic human right to be fuck ups. This civilisation is founded on fuck ups. And you know what? That makes me proud."_  
— **The World's End (2013)**

_"A day so happy.  
Fog lifted early, I worked in the garden.  
Hummingbirds were stopping overhoneysuckle flowers.  
There was no thing on earth I wanted to possess.  
I knew no one worth my envying him.  
Whatever evil I had suffered, I forgot.  
To think that once I was the same man did not embarrass me.  
In my body I felt no pain.  
When straightening up, I saw the blue sea and sails."_  
— **Czesław Miłosz: Gift**

_"Nothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know"_  
— **Michel de Montaigne**

_"I am an old man now and have come to the summit of my years. But in my heart is the joy of youth for I have learned that the essentials of life are near at hand and happiness is his who but opens his eyes to the beauty which lies before him."_  
— **John Burroughs**

_"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a mock-up of reason and order—willed, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living."_  
— **Annie Dillard**

_"If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; blame yourself, tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches; for to the creator there is no poverty and no poor indifferent place."_  
— **Rainer Maria Rilke**

_"People are always shouting they want to create a better future. It's not true. The future is an apathetic void of no interest to anyone. The past is full of life, eager to irritate us, provoke and insult us, tempt us to destroy or repaint it. The only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past."_  
— **Milan Kundera**

_"The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short."_  
— **Arthur Schopenhauer**

_"Since I met you, I feel like I can see the operating system of the world - and it is unrequited love. That is why everyone's doing everything. Every book, opera house, moon shot and manifesto is here because someone, somewhere, lit up silent when someone else came into the room and then quietly burned when they didn't notice them. On the foundation of the billion kisses we never had, I built you this opera house, baby. I shot the president because I didn't know what to say to you. I hoped you'd notice. I hoped you'd notice me. We turn our unsaid things into our life's work."_  
— **Caitlin Moran: How to build a girl**

_"I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."_  
— **Ralph Waldo Emerson**

_"One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something better. These things fill from behind, from beneath, like well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes."_  
— **Annie Dillard: Write Till You Drop**

_"Everybody thought Kennedy and Johnson and Nixon were spending four-and-a-half percent of the Federal budget each year to prove that America owned Science. This was all a fiction. The Apollo Program was an elaborate demonstration of how even the blandest among us are under the heel of the spirit._

_NASA needed astronauts to plant a flag on the Moon. For obvious reasons the astronauts selected were the most reliable type of man America makes: white, straight, center-right and full-starch protestant, each spawned from the union of science and the military. Every last one of them the heart of the heart of the TV dinner demographic. But then they get shot into space._

_They are tossed from the gravity of this planet, tossed across a quarter-million miles of nothing, to be snatched by the Moon after three days of coasting. Eighteen guys did this and twelve descended further to discover the Moon smells like a recently fired gun._

_Every last one of them came back irrevocably changed. America had sent the squarest men it could find to the Moon and the Moon sent back humans."_
