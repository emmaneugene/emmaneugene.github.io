      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Oh.</p>
      <img src="/img/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" height="400">
      <p>
        I am a senior year Computer Science student with a second major in Public Policy at Singapore Management
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, understanding how things work through tinkering, and recombining that knowledge to
        create new solutions. I believe that my skills in software, DIY and working with people put me in good stead to contribute
        towards solving some of the wicked problems of the present. I am especially interested in building reliable software
        that serves the public good and/or developing solutions to mitigate climate change. At the same time, I'm very
        aware that there are a lot of things I don't know yet, and I want to build technical expertise by networking with
        the brigtest people in the field and working in as many high-impact roles as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an impatient optimist. I believe that creating a sustainable and equitable future is well within our means, and
        I want to see it happen in my lifetime. I see challenges as opportunities for problem-solving and avenues for us
        to exercise our collective ingenuity and innate capacity for change - and I believe that those are the traits required
        for any complex system to flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bulk of my experience lies mainly with low-level and systems programming languages like C and Java, but I am
        also fluent with higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript. I have experience working with relational and
        document databases, deploying to cloud provid.ers (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud) and DevOps tooling (Docker,
        Gitlab CI/CD, CloudFormation, Kubernetes). My medium-term goal is to be a site reliability engineer with a deep 
        understanding of low-level systems and hardware, so that I can build and maintain software that handles critical
        production loads on bare-metal infrastructure. In the longer term, I hope to be able to implement these same
        concepts for managing robots and automation at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career aspirations aside, I make it a point to carve out time for volunteering, personal projects, and engaging in varied
        hobbies. I love learning new things about the world and interacting with people who are passionate about their craft. I
        use social media to share snippets of my life, hobbies, and personal recommendations - and I would love to connect
        if you have any interests in common. I'm also dabbling with content creation - writing is and will always be my
        mainstay, but I'm looking into videos and podcasts in the future as well.
      </p>

      <h2>now:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>
        A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Embarking on my final year (or rather 1.5 years) of studies at Singapore Management University. I'm
          planning to graduate in December 2023, and my current focus is on clearing modules for my AI electives and
          second major in Public Policy. Apart from that, I want to devote my effort into low-level systems programming.
          I'm revisiting the first (and currently still my favorite) langauge I learnt - C, but in the context of
          memory exploits on data and function pointers.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Currently working with a robotics startup, <a href="https://www.fabrica.ai/">Fabrica.AI</a>, focusing on 
          DevOps workflows by automating deployments and simulated tests. In the near future, I'll be looking into building new
          features and logic on top of<a href="https://github.com/ros2/ros2">ROS</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - On a temporary hiatus from volunteering at <a href="https://groundupinitiative.com">Ground-Up Initiative (GUI)</a>.
          I'm still working on improving and developing better software workflows for the organization, but I'm taking things a bit 
          slower on that front - at least, until I find more people interested in making the push.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">Learning in public</a> through personal endeavours like
          writing on Substack and Medium, and streaming my coding sessions on YouTube Live. I have a whole backlog of 
          software project ideas, but I maintain a list of the current projects I'm building on my
          <a href="https://github.com/emmaneugene#project-log">Github homepage</a>. I'm pretty busy now, so I'll be developing these
          projects during the term break.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - This is a bit of a nascent idea right now, but I'm exploring ideas to embark on a research programme for a
          coming semester at school, and I'm increasingly interested in the integration of theory and practice in low-level
          programming. I'm currently exploring the safety limitations and vulnerabilities associated with compiled languages, 
          and I also came across this interesting <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html">
          post</a> about the problem areas for compiled languages that have not adequately been addressed yet. At the same
          time, I'm very keen to learn more about Rust, and I've heard some very good things about its compiler and inbuilt 
          provisions for safety. I'd like to delve into this space by learning the language and understanding some of
          the work that's been done with the <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt project</a>,
          and see if I'm able to contribute a little bit to this body of research.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- work -->
    <div id="work-content">
      <p>Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '<a href="https://den.dev/how-i-work">How I work</a>'. Since work 
        is becoming more flexible, multi-threaded, and project-based, I think it's useful to outline my own principles,
        habits and expectations when working with others.
      </p>

      <p>This document will be updated occasionally, but I will primarily be adding content.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Principles</h3>

      <strong>Initiative</strong>
      <p>
        I don't like waiting around for things to get done, or being blocked by excessively bureaucratic processes. I
        would sooner find my way around an obstacle than continue facing the same problem on a regular basis. In an increasingly
        creator-driven economy, initiative pays off dividends.
      </p>

      <strong>Honesty</strong>
      <p>
        Honesty is one of my strongest values. I prefer honest criticism to false praise, and I accord the same treatment to others.
      </p>

      <strong>Fast feedback</strong>
      <p>
        Progress, learning and improvement are all built on the foundation of feedback. I seek out good feedback as frequently
        as I can, ideally from those who are much more experienced than me.
      </p>

      <strong>Perfect is the enemy of good</strong>
      <p>
        It's better to create something scrappy than to hold off on your work because you feel like it isn't good enough.
        The momentum and feedback you get from starting something will trump any potential downsides.
      </p>

      <strong>Push work, pull updates</strong>.
      <p>
        I think the push-pull model used in software development is the most effective way of enabling productivity in a
        way that feels natural and comfortable. You push work to a common source according to your own pace, and keep
        updated with what others have done on the same platform. There is no unnecessary back-and-forth, and people can
        work at their own pace in a non-blocking manner. I strongly believe that this model is equally effective across 
        all fields of creative work, and I try to implement in as many areas of my life as possible.
      </p>
      
      <strong>Principles before rules</strong>
      <p>
        I don't believe in blindly following rules and regulations unless I know why they were implemented. I believe that all 
        rules are derived from intentions and first principles. If you can understand and respect those principles,
        that counts for more.
      </p>
      
      <strong>Fix the mundane problems first</strong>
      <p>
        As much as we celebrate high-key achievements, it's the daily processes that determine whether we succeed or fail
        as individuals, organizations and communities. Without good habits and processes in place, we simply can't speak of
        accomplishing the bigger goals. The work that goes unnoticed and taken for granted is what makes the most impact.
        Make the everyday chores effortless, then aim for greater.
      </p>

      <strong>Always happy to be proven wrong</strong>
      <p>
        I never assume that my knowledge and understanding of anything is complete, and I'm always striving to educate myself
        further - so that I may become less ignorant and more appreciative of the things we take for granted. I don't see any
        shame in being proven wrong, and I'm thankful for these opportunities for learning.
      </p>

      <strong>Assume the best of others</strong>
      <p>
        In a word: trust. It's difficult to build, but the process of building strong relationships always starts with that
        foundation. Most of the time, I'm comfortable with putting my faith in the people I work with, and I don't rush to attribute
        mistakes or wrongdoings to malice. It's nothing complicated, but it's helped me a lot in my relationships with others.
      </p>

      <strong>Don't hold grudges</strong>
      <p>
        It's impossible to go through life without encountering any misunderstandings or conflicts, especially in the context of work.
        I try my best not to take these things personally and make an effort to make amends wherever I can. Even if relationships go
        sour, I don't harp on past mistakes, and I try to be civil to the best of my ability.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Habits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> - I usually work from mornings (~8am) to the late afternoon (~5pm), and leave time outside for creative pursuits.
          I find that I get the best work done in the early mornings, so I try to minimize unnecessary communication during
          this period.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I like batching work together, and I often assign specific days of the week to work on different projects or topics.
          I would prefer work arrangements that enable me to achieve this level of flexibility.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I generally prefer physical meetups and face-to-face communciation when coming up with new ideas, but I'm happy to use
          informal, asynchronous modes like online chats for minor clarifications.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - That being said, I highly appreciate due preparation before any meetings or scheduled appointments. It would great to send
          a primer or agenda for longer meetings.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I strongly dislike busywork and excessive back-and-forth communication. The more things can be automated, information
          can be organized, and complex work can be itemized (such as on lists and kanbans), the better.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I don't expect instantaneous replies, but I would prefer receiving a response within 1 working day if possible.
          if you're busy and can't reply properly at the moment, I'd really appreciate a heads-up.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ul>

        As clichéd as they may seem, I've always thought of quotes as distilled sources of wisdom. Here are some of my

        </li>
        <br>

        </li>
        <br>

          <br> - <strong>The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own

          <br> - <strong>J.M. Barrie</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a

          whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be
          redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
          something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you
          notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be
          afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."</i>

        <br>
        <li><i>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science
          crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have
          been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected
          in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are
          humanity in print."</i>

        </li>
        <br>

        <li><i>"I bargained with Life for a penny,
          <br>and Life would pay no more,

          <br>And the best at hate are those who preach love
          <br>And the best at war finally are those who preach peace</i>

      <p>
        Some of broad-themed questions and problems I'm mulling over - I'm hoping to tackle at least a few of them once 
        I've accumulated enough knowledge, resources and social connections:
      </p>

      
      <p>
        <strong>Electronic waste</strong>: Technology is enabling us to do much more than we were able to before, but there's one
        major issue - we haven't been able to close the loop with broken devices. There are many ways to mitigate this
        problem - by far, the easiest would be making hardware more modular and easy to repair, but beyond that, we 
        urgently need to find methods to recycle the materials from broken hardware in a cost-efficient manner. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Public health</strong>: Implementing policies that target the low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for
        population-level health outcomes - I'm thinking of things like noise and air pollution reduction, expanding green
        spaces (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U">solarpunk</a>), nutrition, sleep and pre-emptive
        health interventions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Cognition</strong>: It's no secret that many of the wicked problems we're facing will only be solved with human
        ingenuity. How do we give ourselves the best shot at those outcomes? I'm increasingly interested in the fields
        of cognitive health, neuroscience and (dare I say it) biohacking. I think there's a wealth of interesting ways
        you can experiment with the elements of your daily routine - and there's really no better time to try it than the
        present.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Robotics</strong>: I believe that human progress is defined by our ability to solve complex problems - from the very 
        earliest days, we built tools to help us accomplish tasks with less effort and time - thereby allowing us to 
        do even more with our limited time and energy. To me, intelligent automation marks the next step of this endeavour.
        I think intelligent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics">nature-inspired</a> robots will be 
        crucial for us to flourish in a changing world, and I'm really keen to learn more about the field.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Energy</strong>: Energy powers everything that we do. It's the foundation of modern society and the crucial
        challenge for us is to provide clean, reliable energy to meet the needs of humanity as soon as possible. Clean energy
        sources like solar and wind are, in many cases, already cheaper than fossil fuels, but the challenge is how to store
        that energy for future use. Beyond new battery technologies, I'm also interested in exploring nuclear power (which I feel
        has been sorely overlooked) - the future of energy is something that I'll continue to keep my eye on.
