      <p>
        Hi! My name is Emmanuel. I've gone by a few nicknames, but most people call me 'Emman'.

        I love solving problems, asking hard questions, and tinkering. I'm looking to use my skills to work in
        high-impact roles tackling challenging engineering problems in an open, collaborative context.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am an <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230408002619/https://bigthink.com/progress/pessimism-is-a-barrier-to-progress/">
          impatient optimist</a>. I believe that creating a sustainable and equitable future is well within our means,
        and I want to contribute to it in my lifetime.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm interested in building software systems that are robust, scalable, secure and performant, and making those
        concepts as accessible as possible. To that end, I share my knowledge through writing, teaching, and
        volunteering opportunities wherever possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my interests and hobbies include strength training, DIY, <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/londo_bells/?hl=en">model kits</a>, nutrition and health science, jazz, and
        books.

        A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's
        going for me at the moment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          - Working as a backend engineer on Shopee's Data Infrastructure team.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          - Setting up a homelab and private network with <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a>.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          - Experimenting with the utility of current AI models in a fully local context.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          - Setting up a writing system for a dev blog.
        </li>

      <p>
        Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '<a href="https://den.dev/how-i-work">How I work</a>':
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          - I'm a big proponent of prototyping and validating ideas as soon as possible, for which software is uniquely
          suited as the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.279.5353.992">third culture</a>.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          - If it wasn't obvious by now, I spend a lot of time on documentation and writing.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          - I strive to keep responses to 2 working days, and I'll give a heads-up otherwise.
        </li><br />
        <li>
          - Ask me questions! Give me feedback! As a rule of thumb, I believe every decision is open to criticism.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>quotes:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>

      <p>
        As clich√©d as they may seem, I think <a href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/">quotes</a> serve as valuable reminders
        in daily life. Here are some of my personal favorites (and a small selection of poem snippets):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."</i><br />
          - <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance
            requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."</i><br />
          - <strong>Carlos Castaneda</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of
            being."</i><br />
          - <strong>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake
            of reward, nor should you long for inaction."</i><br />
          - <strong>The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>
            "People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character."
          </i><br />
          - <strong>Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"Practice yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and thence proceed to greater."</i><br />
          - <strong>Epictetus</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"All cruelty stems from weakness."</i><br />
          - <strong>Seneca</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone."</i><br />
          - <strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"Those who bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves."</i><br />
          - <strong>J.M. Barrie</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a
            force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the
            world will not devote itself to making you happy."</i><br />
          - <strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong,
            neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but
            time and chance happeneth to them all."</i><br />
          - <strong>Ecclesiastes 9:11 (KJV)</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one ‚Äî the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings,
            without milestones, without signposts."</i><br />
          - <strong>C.S. Lewis</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and
            whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be
            redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
            something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely
            you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't
            be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."</i><br />
          - <strong>Mary Oliver</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li><i>"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."</i> <br />
          - <strong>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science
            crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have
            been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected
            in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books
            are humanity in print."</i><br />
          - <strong>Barbara Tuchman</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone
            gets busy on the proof."</i><br />
          - <strong>John Kenneth Galbraith</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else."</i><br />
          - <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong>
        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>
            "I bargained with Life for a penny,<br />
            and Life would pay no more,<br />
            However I begged at evening<br />
            When I counted my scanty store;<br />
            <br />
            Life is a just employer.<br />
            He gives you what you ask,<br />
            But once you have set the wages,<br />
            Why, you must bear the task.<br />
            <br />
            I worked for amenial's hire,<br />
            Only to learn, dismayed,<br />
            That any wage I had asked of Life<br />
            Life would have willingly paid."

        </li><br />
        <li>
          <i>
            "There is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average<br />
            Human being to supply any given army on any given day<br />
            And the best at murder are those who preach against it<br />
            And the best at hate are those who preach love<br />
            And the best at war finally are those who preach peace"

            "I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any
            religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth,
            being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any

            "We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are
            never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never
            see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater
            poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by
            our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and

            what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a
            scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a
            mock-up of reason and order‚Äîwilled, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the
            wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living."</i><br />

          <i>"People are always shouting they want to create a better future. It's not true. The future is an apathetic
            void of no interest to anyone. The past is full of life, eager to irritate us, provoke and insult us, tempt
            us to destroy or repaint it. The only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the

        <li>
          <i>"The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be
            engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical
            pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools
            always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is

            someone, somewhere, lit up silent when someone else came into the room and then quietly burned when they
            didn't notice them. On the foundation of the billion kisses we never had, I built you this opera house,
            baby. I shot the president because I didn't know what to say to you. I hoped you'd notice. I hoped you'd
            notice me. We turn our unsaid things into our life's work."</i><br />

            "One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right
            away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it,
            give it all, now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now.
            Something more will arise for later, something better. These things fill from behind, from beneath, like
            well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is
            destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find
            ashes."

            "Everybody thought Kennedy and Johnson and Nixon were spending four-and-a-half percent of the Federal
            budget each year to prove that America owned Science. This was all a fiction. The Apollo Program was an
            elaborate demonstration of how even the blandest among us are under the heel of the spirit.<br />
            <br />
            NASA needed astronauts to plant a flag on the Moon. For obvious reasons the astronauts selected were the
            most reliable type of man America makes: white, straight, center-right and full-starch protestant, each
            spawned from the union of science and the military. Every last one of them the heart of the heart of the TV
            dinner demographic. But then they get shot into space.<br />
            <br />
            They are tossed from the gravity of this planet, tossed across a quarter-million miles of nothing, to be
            snatched by the Moon after three days of coasting. Eighteen guys did this and twelve descended further to
            discover the Moon smells like a recently fired gun.<br />
            <br />
            Every last one of them came back irrevocably changed. America had sent the squarest men it could find to the
            Moon and the Moon sent back humans."

      <p>These some problem areas I'd like to devote time and/or resources into solving:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Energy</strong>: Energy powers everything that we do, and our biggest challenge is to provide clean,
        reliable sources to meet humanity's needs as soon as possible. Renewables like solar and wind are in many cases
        already cheaper than fossil fuels, but we desperately need innovation in many more areas to get to a future
        where energy is abundant and carbon-neutral.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Repair culture</strong>: Technology is great, but the one thing nobody talks about is what happens when
        it stops working. Modern appliances have incredibly short shelf lives and are often designed to be <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">replaced</a>, with disastrous consequences for the
        environment. I'm interested in any and all efforts to make DIY and repair more accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Public health</strong>: Implementing policies that target low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for
        community-level health outcomes - I believe there's a lot of missed value in quantifying the impact of
        environmental influences like noise and <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/pollution">air pollution</a>,
        expanding green spaces (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U">solarpunk</a>), and
        improving nutrition and sleep as pre-emptive health interventions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Robotics</strong>: Software on its own is complex, but we've barely scratched the surface of making
        software that interacts with the physical world. We're probably a long way away, but I believe that <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics">nature-inspired</a> robots will be crucial for us to flourish
        in a changing world, and it's a space that I'm very excited about.
