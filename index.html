      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel. I've gone by many nicknames, but 'Emman' usually works.</p>
      <img src="/img/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" height="400">
      <p>
        I am currently in my senior year at Singapore Management University, reading Computer Science with a second
        major in Public Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, asking hard questions, and tinkering. I'm looking to use my skills to work in
        high-impact roles tackling some of the biggest challenges of the present, and my current focus is on building
        reliable software solutions which serve the public good and/or help to mitigate climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an <a href="https://bigthink.com/progress/pessimism-is-a-barrier-to-progress/">impatient optimist</a>.
        I believe that creating a sustainable and equitable future is well within our means, and I want to see it
        happen in my lifetime. I view crises as opportunities to exercise our collective ingenuity and capacity for
        change - which I believe are fundamental traits required for any complex system to flourish. However,
        I'm aware that there are a lot of things I still don't know yet, and I'd like to develop my expertise by 
        working with the brightest people in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bulk of my experience and interest lies with low-level systems programming languages like C and Java, but
        I am fluent with higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript. I have experience working with relational
        and document databases, deploying to cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud) and DevOps tooling 
        (Docker, Gitlab CI/CD, AWS CloudFormation, Kubernetes). As part of my major in AI, I also have a decent grasp of
        common data science and ML libraries in Python. My medium-term goal is to be a site reliability engineer
        with a deep understanding of low-level systems and hardware, so that I can build and maintain software that
        handles critical production loads on bare-metal infrastructure. In the longer term, I'm aiming to apply these
        skills towards managing and enabling the automation of robotics deployments at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career aspirations aside, I make it a point to carve out time for volunteering, personal projects, and engaging
        in varied hobbies. I love learning new things about the world and interacting with people who are passionate
        about their craft. I share snippets of my life, hobbies, and personal recommendations on social media, and I'd
        love to connect over any common interests. I'm also looking to expend further into content creation as a means
        to express my ideas - writing is and always will be my primary outlet, but I'd like to try making videos and
        podcasts in the future as well.

      <p>
        A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Done with another semester of school! Wrapping up exams now and I've got about 2 months to really focus
          on personal projects and learning üéâ I'm looking to tackle the backlog on my Github 
          <a href="https://github.com/emmaneugene/emmaneugene">README</a>. Most of my efforts to
          <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">learn in public</a> will involve developing these projects in
          public repos, writing documentation/tutorials, and maybe some articles on Medium if I can organize my thoughts
          enough.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Working on robotics software development at <a href="https://www.fabrica.ai">Fabrica.AI</a>, focusing on 
          DevOps workflows with automated deployments, simulated tests, and building new features and logic on top of
          <a href="https://github.com/ros2/ros2">ROS</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Alongside work and personal projects, I'm learning as much as I can about systems, Linux, tooling and
          workflows that will help me become more productive on the command line. I've always been inpsired by work
          done in the open source community, and I'm tuning in to news, threads and conferences so I can get more
          involved.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - This is a bit of a nascent idea right now, but I'm exploring ideas to embark on a research programme for
          my final semester. I'm increasingly interested in opportunities to integrate formal computer science theory
          with practice in the realm of low-level programming. One particularly interesting area for me is looking into
          the safety limitations and vulnerabilities associated with compiled languages. I also came across this
          interesting <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html"> post</a> about the problem areas for
          compiled languages that haven't adequately been addressed yet. I figure that once I learn Rust properly, I can
          start reading up on some of the existing research done under the 
          <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt project</a>, and hopefully make a contribution of
          my own.
        </li>

    <div id="work-content">
      <h2>work:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '<a href="https://den.dev/how-i-work">How I work</a>'. Since work 
        is becoming more flexible, multi-threaded, and project-based, I think it's useful to outline my own principles,
        habits and expectations when working with others.
      </p>

      <p>This document will be updated occasionally, but I will primarily be adding content.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Principles</h3>

      <strong>Initiative</strong>
      <p>
        I don't like waiting around for things to get done, or being blocked by excessively bureaucratic processes. I
        would sooner find my way around an obstacle than continue facing the same problem on a regular basis. In an
        increasingly creator-driven economy, initiative pays off disproportionately.
      </p>

      <strong>Honesty</strong>
      <p>
        Honesty is one of my strongest values. I prefer honest criticism to false praise, and I accord the same 
        treatment to others.
      </p>

      <strong>Fast feedback</strong>
      <p>
        Progress, learning and improvement are all built on the foundation of feedback. I seek out good feedback as
        frequently as I can, ideally from those who are much more experienced than me.
      </p>

      <strong>Perfect is the enemy of good</strong>
      <p>
        It's better to create something scrappy than to hold off on your work because you feel like it isn't good
        enough. The momentum and feedback you get from starting something will trump any potential downsides.
      </p>

      <strong>Push work, pull updates</strong>.
      <p>
        I think the push-pull model used in software development is the most effective way of enabling productivity in a
        way that feels natural and comfortable. You push work to a common source according to your own pace, and keep
        updated with what others have done on the same platform. There is no unnecessary back-and-forth, and people can
        work at their own pace in a non-blocking manner. I strongly believe that this model is equally effective across 
        all fields of creative work, and I try to implement in as many areas of my life as possible.
      </p>
      
      <strong>Principles before rules</strong>
      <p>
        I don't believe in blindly following rules and regulations unless I know why they were implemented. I believe 
        that all rules are derived from intentions and first principles. If you can understand and respect those
        principles, that counts for more.
      </p>
      
      <strong>Fix the mundane problems first</strong>
      <p>
        As much as we celebrate high-key achievements, it's the daily processes that determine whether we succeed or 
        fail as individuals, organizations and communities. Without good habits and processes in place, we simply can't
        speak of accomplishing the bigger goals. The work that goes unnoticed and taken for granted is what makes the
        most impact. Make the everyday chores effortless, then aim for greater.
      </p>

      <strong>Always happy to be proven wrong</strong>
      <p>
        I never assume that my knowledge and understanding of anything is complete, and I'm always striving to educate
        myself further - so that I may become less ignorant and more appreciative of the things we take for granted. I
        don't see any shame in being proven wrong, and I'm thankful for these opportunities for learning.
      </p>

      <strong>Assume the best of others</strong>
      <p>
        In a word: trust. It's difficult to build, but the process of building strong relationships always starts with
        that foundation. Most of the time, I'm comfortable with putting my faith in the people I work with, and I don't
        rush to attribute mistakes or wrongdoings to malice. It's nothing complicated, but it's helped me a lot in my
        relationships with others.
      </p>

      <strong>Don't hold grudges</strong>
      <p>
        It's impossible to go through life without encountering any misunderstandings or conflicts, especially in the
        context of work. I try my best not to take these things personally and make an effort to make amends wherever I
        can. Even if relationships go sour, I don't harp on past mistakes, and I try to be civil to the best of my
        ability.
      </p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Habits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> - I usually work from mornings to the late afternoon (8am - 3pm), and leave time outside for creative
          pursuits. I find that I get the best work done in the early mornings, so I try to minimize unnecessary
          communication during this period.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I like batching work together, and I often assign specific days of the week to work on different projects
          or topics. I greatly prefer work arrangements that enable me to achieve this level of flexibility.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I generally prefer physical meetups and face-to-face communciation when coming up with new ideas, but I'm
          happy to use informal, asynchronous modes like online chats for minor clarifications.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - That being said, I highly appreciate due preparation before any meetings or scheduled appointments. It
          would great to send a primer or agenda for longer meetings.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I strongly dislike busywork and excessive back-and-forth communication. The more things can be automated,
        information can be organized, and complex work can be itemized (such as on lists and kanbans), the better.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I don't expect instantaneous replies, but I would prefer receiving a response within 1 working day if
          possible. If you're busy and can't reply properly at the moment, I'd really appreciate a heads-up.
        </li>
        <br>

      <h2>quotes:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>
        As clich√©d as they may seem, I think quotes are excellent sources of wisdom and valuable reminders in daily
        life. Here are some of my personal favorites:

        </li>
        <br>

          <br> - <strong>The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own

        <li><i>"Those who bring sunshine into the live of others cannot keep it from themseves."</i>
          <br> - <strong>J.M. Barrie</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a

          whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be
          redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
          something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you
          notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be
          afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."</i>

        <br>
        <li><i>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science
          crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have
          been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected
          in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are

          being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever,
          cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or

      <p>
        Some of broad-themed questions and problems I'm mulling over - I'm hoping to tackle at least a few of them once 
        I've accumulated enough knowledge, resources and social connections:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Electronic waste</strong>: Technology is enabling us to do much more than we were able to before, but there's one
        major issue - we haven't been able to close the loop with broken devices. There are many ways to mitigate this
        problem - by far, the easiest would be making hardware more modular and easy to repair, but beyond that, we 
        urgently need to find methods to recycle the materials from broken hardware in a cost-efficient manner. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Public health</strong>: Implementing policies that target the low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for
        population-level health outcomes - I'm thinking of things like noise and air pollution reduction, expanding green
        spaces (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U">solarpunk</a>), nutrition, sleep and pre-emptive
        health interventions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Cognition</strong>: It's no secret that many of the wicked problems we're facing will only be solved with human
        ingenuity. How do we give ourselves the best shot at those outcomes? I'm increasingly interested in the fields
        of cognitive health, neuroscience and (dare I say it) biohacking. I think there's a wealth of interesting ways
        you can experiment with the elements of your daily routine - and there's really no better time to try it than the
        present.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Robotics</strong>: I believe that human progress is defined by our ability to solve complex problems - from the very 
        earliest days, we built tools to help us accomplish tasks with less effort and time - thereby allowing us to 
        do even more with our limited time and energy. To me, intelligent automation marks the next step of this endeavour.
        I think intelligent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics">nature-inspired</a> robots will be 
        crucial for us to flourish in a changing world, and I'm really keen to learn more about the field.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Energy</strong>: Energy powers everything that we do. It's the foundation of modern society and the crucial
        challenge for us is to provide clean, reliable energy to meet the needs of humanity as soon as possible. Clean energy
        sources like solar and wind are, in many cases, already cheaper than fossil fuels, but the challenge is how to store
        that energy for future use. Beyond new battery technologies, I'm also interested in exploring nuclear power (which I feel
        has been sorely overlooked) - the future of energy is something that I'll continue to keep my eye on.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mental Health</strong>: Interest in mental health is growing at a stronger pace than ever, spurred by anxieties about
        the future, the breakneck pace of modern life, and the erosion of strong social communities and the civic bonds which used to
        bind us together. How do we prepare people - young and old - to thrive in this environment? How can we redesign policies, 
        institutions and systems to be more humane? There are no easy answers when it comes to this, but if there's anything I know
        for sure, it's that change can only begin once we're willing to have these conversations openly.
