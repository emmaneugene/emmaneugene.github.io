      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Oh.</p>
      <p>
        I am a final year Computer Science student wih a second major in Public Policy at Singapore Management University
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, learning how things work under the hood, and recombining knowledge to create new ideas. I believe that my skills in software, DIY and working with people put me in good stead to make a dent in solving some of the wicked problems we face. I am especially interested in building reliable software that serves the public good or tackles pertinent issues relating to climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience lies mainly with low-level and systems programming languages like C and Java, but I am also fluent with interpreted languages like Python and JavaScript. I have worked with both relational and document databases and have experience with cloud deployments (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud) and devops tooling (Docker, Gitlab, CloudFormation, Kubernetes). I am currently spending my time on full-stack web development, functional programming, and grokking the linux kernel.

      <p>A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Embarking on my final year (or rather 1.5 years) of studies at Singapore Management University. I'm planning to graduate in December 2023, and my current focus is on clearing modules for my AI electives and second major in Public Policy. Apart from that, I want to devote my effort into low-level systems programming. I'm revisiting the first (and currently still my favorite) langauge I learnt - C, but in the context of software vulnerabilities and exploits relating to memory and buffer overflow exploits. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Volunteering as a team lead at <a href="https://groundupinitiative.com">Ground-Up Initiative (GUI)</a> on the weekends, and I'm looking to play a more active role in building software to streamline workflows and help the organization retain and train volunteers. GUI has big ambitions for the future, and I believe that good software is integral to achieving that.</li>
        <br>
        <li> - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">Learning in public</a> through personal endeavours like writing on Substack, streaming my coding sessions on YouTube Live, and sharing my interests on social media. I have a list of software projects I want to finish by the end of the year -  a disk usage visualizer with electron.js and D3.js, and a general feed integrator (RSS and Twitter, but with support for further media down the line) using a full-stack - most likely MERN.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This is a bit of a nascent idea right now, but I'm exploring ideas to embark on a research programme for a coming semester at school, and I'm increasingly interested in formal methods and compilers. I like dealing with low-level details in code, and I came across this interesting <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html">post</a>< about the problem areas for compiled languages that have not adequately been addressed yet. At the same time, I'm gaining more interest in the Rust language, and I've heard some very good things about its performance and safety. I'd like to delve into this space by learning the language and understanding some of the work that's been done with the <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt project</a>, and see if I'm able to contribute a little bit to the body of research that's been done so far.</li>
