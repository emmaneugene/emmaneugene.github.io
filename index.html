      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Oh.</p>
      <p>
        I am a final year Computer Science student wih a second major in Public Policy at Singapore Management University
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, learning how things work under the hood, and recombining knowledge to create new ideas. I believe that my skills in software, DIY and working with people put me in good stead to make a dent in solving some of the wicked problems we face. I am especially interested in building reliable software that serves the public good or tackles pertinent issues relating to climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience lies mainly with low-level and systems programming languages like C and Java, but I am also fluent with interpreted languages like Python and JavaScript. I have worked with both relational and document databases and have experience with cloud deployments (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud) and devops tooling (Docker, Gitlab, CloudFormation, Kubernetes). My long-term goal is to be a full-stack developer with a deep understanding of low-level systems and hardware, so that I can build and maintain software which can handle critical production loads on bare-metal infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career aspirations aside, I love learning new things about the world and interacting with people who are passionate about their craft. I use social media (mainly instagram) to share my snippets of my life, hobbies and recommendations, and I would love to connect if you have any interests in common. I'm also dipping my toes into the world of content creation - writing is my mainstay, but I'm looking into videos and podcasts in the future as well.
      </p>

    <div id="now-content">
      <h2>now:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Embarking on my final year (or rather 1.5 years) of studies at Singapore Management University. I'm planning to graduate in December 2023, and my current focus is on clearing modules for my AI electives and second major in Public Policy. Apart from that, I want to devote my effort into low-level systems programming. I'm revisiting the first (and currently still my favorite) langauge I learnt - C, but in the context of software vulnerabilities and exploits relating to memory and buffer overflow exploits. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Volunteering as a team lead at <a href="https://groundupinitiative.com">Ground-Up Initiative (GUI)</a> on the weekends, and I'm looking to play a more active role in building software to streamline workflows and help the organization retain and train volunteers. GUI has big ambitions for the future, and I believe that good software is integral to achieving that.</li>
        <br>
        <li> - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">Learning in public</a> through personal endeavours like writing on Substack, streaming my coding sessions on YouTube Live, and sharing my interests on social media. I have a list of software projects I want to finish by the end of the year -  a disk usage visualizer with electron.js and D3.js, and a general feed integrator (RSS and Twitter, but with support for further media down the line) using a full-stack - most likely MERN.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This is a bit of a nascent idea right now, but I'm exploring ideas to embark on a research programme for a coming semester at school, and I'm increasingly interested in formal methods and compilers. I like dealing with low-level details in code, and I came across this interesting <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html">post</a>< about the problem areas for compiled languages that have not adequately been addressed yet. At the same time, I'm gaining more interest in the Rust language, and I've heard some very good things about its performance and safety. I'd like to delve into this space by learning the language and understanding some of the work that's been done with the <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt project</a>, and see if I'm able to contribute a little bit to the body of research that's been done so far.</li>

    <div id="quotes-content">
      <h2>quotes:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>As clichéd as they may seem, I've always thought of quotes as distilled sources of wisdom. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth"<br> - Muhammad Ali"</li>
        <br>
        <li>"What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."<br> - Carlos Castaneda</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being."<br> - Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</li>
        <br>
        <li>"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction"<br> - The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</li>
        <br>
        <li>"The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within."<br> - Marcus Aurelius</li>
        <br>
        <li>"People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character."<br> - Ralph Waldo Emerson</li>
        <br>
        <li>"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run."<br> - Henry David Thoreau</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Practice yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and thence proceed to greater."<br> - Epictetus</li>
        <br>
        <li>"It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society."<br> - Jiddu Krishnamurti</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform wihout thinking of them."<br> - Alfred North Whitehead</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one"<br> - Marcus Aurelius</li>
        <br>
        <li>"All cruelty stems from weakness."<br> - Seneca</li>
        <br>
        <li>"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone."<br> - Henry David Thoreau</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Those who bring sunshine into the live of others cannot keep it from themseves."<br> - J.M. Barrie</li>
        <br>
        <li>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a force of nature instead of a  feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."<br> - George Bernard Shaw</li>
        <br>
        <li>"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all."<br> - Ecclesiastes 9:11 (KJV)</li>
        <br>
        <li>"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one — the gentle slope,  soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without  signposts."<br> - C.S. Lewis</li>
        <br>
        <li>"If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."<br> - Mary Oliver</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."<br> - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are humanity in print."<br> - Barbara Tuchman</li>
        <br>
        <li>"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof."<br> - John Kenneth Galbraith</li>
        <br>
        <li>"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else."<br> - Charlie Chaplin</li>
