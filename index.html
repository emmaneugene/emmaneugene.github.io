      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Oh.</p>
      <img src="/img/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" height="400">
      <p>
        I am a senior year Computer Science student wih a second major in Public Policy at Singapore Management
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, understanding how things work by taking them apart, and recombining that knowledge to
        create new ideas. I believe that my skills in software, DIY and working with people put me in good stead to make
        a dent in solving some of the wicked problems we face. I am especially interested in building reliable software
        that serves the public good or tackles pertinent issues relating to climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bulk of my experience lies mainly with low-level and systems programming languages like C and Java, but I am
        also fluent with higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript. I have experience working with relational and
        document databases, deploying to cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud) and DevOps tooling (Docker,
        Gitlab, CloudFormation, Kubernetes). My long-term goal is to be a site reliability engineer with a deep 
        understanding of low-level systems and hardware, so that I can build and maintain software that handles critical
        production loads on bare-metal infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career aspirations aside, I make it a point to carve out time for volunteering, personal projects, and engaging in varied
        hobbies. I love learning new things about the world and interacting with people who are passionate about their craft. I
        use social media to share my snippets of my life, hobbies, and personal recommendations - and I would love to connect
        if you have any interests in common. I'm also dabbling with content creation - writing is and will always be my
        mainstay, but I'm looking into videos and podcasts in the future as well.
      </p>

      <h2>now:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>
        A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Embarking on my final year (or rather 1.5 years) of studies at Singapore Management University. I'm
          planning to graduate in December 2023, and my current focus is on clearing modules for my AI electives and
          second major in Public Policy. Apart from that, I want to devote my effort into low-level systems programming.
          I'm revisiting the first (and currently still my favorite) langauge I learnt - C, but in the context of
          software vulnerabilities and exploits relating to memory and buffer overflow exploits.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Volunteering as a team lead at <a href="https://groundupinitiative.com">Ground-Up Initiative (GUI)</a> on
          the weekends, and I'm looking to play a more active role in building software to streamline workflows and help
          the organization retain and train volunteers. GUI has big ambitions for the future, and I believe that good
          software is integral to achieving that. If you'd like to get involved, please let me know!</li>
        <br>
        <li> - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">Learning in public</a> through personal endeavours like
          writing on Substack, streaming my coding sessions on YouTube Live, and sharing my interests on social media. I
          have a list of software projects I want to finish by the end of the year - a disk usage visualizer with
          electron.js and D3.js, and a general feed integrator (RSS and Twitter, but with support for further media down
          the line) using a full-stack - most likely MERN.</li>
        <br>
        <li> - This is a bit of a nascent idea right now, but I'm exploring ideas to embark on a research programme for a
          coming semester at school, and I'm increasingly interested in the integration of theory and practice in low-level
          programming. I'm currently exploring the safety limitations and vulnerabilities associated with compiled languages, 
          and I also came across this interesting <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html">
          post</a> about the problem areas for compiled languages that have not adequately been addressed yet. At the same
          time, I'm very keen to learn more about Rust, and I've heard some very good things about its compiler and inbuilt 
          provisions for safety. I'd like to delve into this space by learning the language and understanding some of
          the work that's been done with the <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt project</a>,
          and see if I'm able to contribute a little bit to this body of research.

      <p>
        As clich√©d as they may seem, I've always thought of quotes as distilled sources of wisdom. Here are some of my
        favorites:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."</i><br> - <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance
          requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."</i><br> - <strong>Carlos Castaneda</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of
          being."</i><br> - <strong>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake
          of reward, nor should you long for inaction."</i><br> - <strong>The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own
          disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within."</i><br> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character."</i><br> -
          Ralph Waldo Emerson
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it,
          immediately or in the long run."</i><br> - <strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Practice yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and thence proceed to greater."</i><br> - <strong>Epictetus</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society."</i><br> - <strong>Jiddu Krishnamurti</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform wihout thinking
          of them."</i><br> - <strong>Alfred North Whitehead</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one."</i><br> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"All cruelty stems from weakness."</i><br> - <strong>Seneca</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone."</i><br> - <strong>Henry David</strong>
          Thoreau
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Those who bring sunshine into the live of others cannot keep it from themseves."</i><br> - <strong>J.M. Barrie</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a
          force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the
          world will not devote itself to making you happy."</i><br> - <strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong, neither
          yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and
          chance happeneth to them all."</i><br> - <strong>Ecclesiastes 9:11 (KJV)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one ‚Äî the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings,
          without milestones, without signposts."</i><br> - <strong>C.S. Lewis</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and
          whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be
          redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
          something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you
          notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be
          afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."</i><br> - <strong>Mary Oliver</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."</i><br> - <strong>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science
          crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have
          been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected
          in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are
          humanity in print."</i><br> - <strong>Barbara Tuchman</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone
          gets busy on the proof."</i><br> - <strong>John Kenneth Galbraith</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else."</i><br> - <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I bargained with Life for a penny,<br>and Life would pay no more,<br>However I begged at evening<br>When I counted my scanty store;<br><br>Life is a just employer.<br>He gives you what you ask,<br>But once you have set the wages,<br>Why, you must bear the task.<br><br>I worked for a menial's hire,<br>Only to learn, dismayed,<br>That any wage I had asked of Life<br>Life would have willingly paid."</i><br> - <strong>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Let us, then, be up and doing,<br>With a heart for any fate;<br>Still achieving, still pursuing,<br>Learn to labor and to wait."</i><br> - <strong>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: A </strong>Psalm of Life

      <p>I'm often (and perhaps too easily) inspired by people who invest deeply into their work and create things which
        have a lasting impact in the spaces in which they interact. I've compiled a non-exhaustive list of individuals
        and organizations whose work spurs me to do better:

        Some of broad-themed questions and problems I'm mulling over - I'm hoping to tackle at least a few of them once I've accumulated enough knowledge, resources and social connections:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Repair culture: Making electronics much easier to repair, closing the loop with e-waste recycling,
          reducing the embodied energy cost of manufacturing hardware.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Public health: Implementing policies that target the low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for
          population-level health outcomes - I'm thinking of the reduction of noise and air pollution, expanding green
          spaces (solarpunk), nutrition, sleep and preventative or pre-emptive health interventions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Cognition: It's no secret that many of the wicked problems we're facing will only be solved with human
          ingenuity. How do we give ourselves the best shot at those outcomes? I'm increasingly interested in the field
          of neuroscience and (dare I say it) biohacking. I think there's a wealth of interesting ways you can
          experiment with the elements of your daily routine - and there's no better time to try it.
