      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Oh.</p>
      <img src="/img/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" height="400">
      <p>
        I am a senior year Computer Science student with a second major in Public Policy at Singapore Management
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, understanding how things work through tinkering, and recombining that knowledge to
        create new ideas. I believe that my skills in software, DIY and working with people put me in good stead to make
        a dent in solving some of the wicked problems we face. I am especially interested in building reliable software
        that serves the public good or tackles pertinent issues relating to climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bulk of my experience lies mainly with low-level and systems programming languages like C and Java, but I am
        also fluent with higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript. I have experience working with relational and
        document databases, deploying to cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud) and DevOps tooling (Docker,
        Gitlab CI/CD, CloudFormation, Kubernetes). My long-term goal is to be a site reliability engineer with a deep 
        understanding of low-level systems and hardware, so that I can build and maintain software that handles critical
        production loads on bare-metal infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career aspirations aside, I make it a point to carve out time for volunteering, personal projects, and engaging in varied
        hobbies. I love learning new things about the world and interacting with people who are passionate about their craft. I
        use social media to share my snippets of my life, hobbies, and personal recommendations - and I would love to connect
        if you have any interests in common. I'm also dabbling with content creation - writing is and will always be my
        mainstay, but I'm looking into videos and podcasts in the future as well.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- now -->
    <div id="now-content">
      <h2>now:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>
        A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Embarking on my final year (or rather 1.5 years) of studies at Singapore Management University. I'm
          planning to graduate in December 2023, and my current focus is on clearing modules for my AI electives and
          second major in Public Policy. Apart from that, I want to devote my effort into low-level systems programming.
          I'm revisiting the first (and currently still my favorite) langauge I learnt - C, but in the context of
          memory exploits on data and function pointers.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Volunteering as a team lead at <a href="https://groundupinitiative.com">Ground-Up Initiative (GUI)</a> on
          the weekends, and I'm looking to play a more active role in building software to streamline workflows and help
          the organization retain and train volunteers. GUI has big ambitions for the future, and I believe that good
          software is integral to achieving that. If you'd like to get involved, please let me know!</li>
        <br>
        <li> - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">Learning in public</a> through personal endeavours like
          writing on Substack and Medium, and streaming my coding sessions on YouTube Live. I have a whole backlog of 
          software project ideas, but I maintain a list of the current projects I'm building on my
          <a href="https://github.com/emmaneugene#project-log">Github homepage</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - This is a bit of a nascent idea right now, but I'm exploring ideas to embark on a research programme for a
          coming semester at school, and I'm increasingly interested in the integration of theory and practice in low-level
          programming. I'm currently exploring the safety limitations and vulnerabilities associated with compiled languages, 
          and I also came across this interesting <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html">
          post</a> about the problem areas for compiled languages that have not adequately been addressed yet. At the same
          time, I'm very keen to learn more about Rust, and I've heard some very good things about its compiler and inbuilt 
          provisions for safety. I'd like to delve into this space by learning the language and understanding some of
          the work that's been done with the <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt project</a>,
          and see if I'm able to contribute a little bit to this body of research.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- work -->
    <div id="work-content">
      <p>Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '<a href="https://den.dev/how-i-work">How I work</a>'. Since work 
        is becoming more flexible, multi-threaded, and project-based, I think it's useful to outline my own principles,
        habits and expectations when working with others.
      </p>

      <p>This document will be updated as time goes on.</p>

      <h3>Principles</h3>

      <strong>Initiative</strong>
      <p>
        I don't like waiting around for things to get done, or being blocked by excessively bureaucratic processes. I
        would sooner find my way around an obstacle than continue facing the same problem on a regular basis.
      </p>

      <strong>Honesty</strong>
      <p>
        Honesty is one of my strongest values. I prefer honest criticism to false praise, and I accord the same treatment to others.
      </p>

      <strong>Fast feedback</strong>
      <p>
        Progress, learning and improvement are all built on the foundation of feedback. I seek out good feedback as frequently
        as I can, ideally from those who are much more experienced than me.
      </p>

      <strong>Perfect is the enemy of good</strong>
      <p>
        It's better to create something scrappy than to hold off on your work because you feel like it isn't good enough.
        The momentum you build from starting something will trump any potential downsides.
      </p>

      <strong>Push work, pull information</strong>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h3>Habits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> - I usually work from mornings (~8am) to the late afternoon (~5pm), and leave time outside for creative pursuits.
          I find that I get the best work done in the early mornings, so I try to minimize unnecessary communication during
          this period.
        </li>
        <li> - I like batching work together, and I often assign specific days of the week to work on different projects or topics.
          I would prefer work arrangements that enable me to achieve this level of flexibility.
        </li>
        <li> - I generally prefer physical meetups and face-to-face communciation when coming up with new ideas, but I'm happy to use
          informal, asynchronous modes like online chats for minor clarifications.
        </li>
        <li> - That being said, I highly appreciate due preparation before any meetings or scheduled appointments. It would great to send
          a primer or agenda for longer meetings! 
        </li>
        <li> - I strongly dislike busywork and excessive back-and-forth communication. The more things can be automated, information
          can be organized, and complex work can be itemized (such as on lists and kanbans), the better.
        </li>
        <li> - I don't expect instantaneous replies, but I would prefer receiving a response within 1 working day if possible.
          if you're busy and can't reply properly at the moment, I'd really appreciate a heads-up.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>quotes:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>
        As clichéd as they may seem, I've always thought of quotes as distilled sources of wisdom. Here are some of my
        favorites:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance
          requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Carlos Castaneda</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of
          being."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake
          of reward, nor should you long for inaction."</i>
          <br> - <strong>The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own
          disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character."</i>
          <br> -
          Ralph Waldo Emerson
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it,
          immediately or in the long run."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Practice yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and thence proceed to greater."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Epictetus</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Jiddu Krishnamurti</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform wihout thinking
          of them."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Alfred North Whitehead</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"All cruelty stems from weakness."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Seneca</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Henry David</strong>
          Thoreau
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Those who bring sunshine into the live of others cannot keep it from themseves."</i>
          <br> - <strong>J.M. Barrie</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a
          force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the
          world will not devote itself to making you happy."</i>
          <br> - <strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong, neither
          yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and
          chance happeneth to them all."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Ecclesiastes 9:11 (KJV)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one — the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings,
          without milestones, without signposts."</i>
          <br> - <strong>C.S. Lewis</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and
          whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be
          redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
          something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you
          notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't be
          afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Mary Oliver</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."</i>
          <br> - <strong>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science
          crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have
          been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected
          in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books are
          humanity in print."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Barbara Tuchman</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone
          gets busy on the proof."</i>
          <br> - <strong>John Kenneth Galbraith</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I bargained with Life for a penny,
          <br>and Life would pay no more,
          <br>However I begged at evening
          <br>When I counted my scanty store;
          <br>
          <br>Life is a just employer.
          <br>He gives you what you ask,
          <br>But once you have set the wages,
          <br>Why, you must bear the task.
          <br>
          <br>I worked for a menial's hire,
          <br>Only to learn, dismayed,
          <br>That any wage I had asked of Life
          <br>Life would have willingly paid."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Let us, then, be up and doing,
          <br>With a heart for any fate;

        Some of broad-themed questions and problems I'm mulling over - I'm hoping to tackle at least a few of them once 
        I've accumulated enough knowledge, resources and social connections:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Electronic waste: Technology is enabling us to do much more than we were able to befoe, but there's one
          major issue - we haven't been able to close the loop with broken devices. There are many ways to mitigate this
          problem - by far, the easiest would be making hardware more modular and easy to repair, but beyond that, we 
          urgently need to find methods to recycle the materials from broken hardware in a cost-efficient manner. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Public health: Implementing policies that target the low-hanging fruit and make the most impact for
          population-level health outcomes - I'm thinking of the reduction of noise and air pollution, expanding green
          spaces (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U"></a>solarpunk), nutrition, sleep and pre-emptive
          health interventions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Cognition: It's no secret that many of the wicked problems we're facing will only be solved with human
          ingenuity. How do we give ourselves the best shot at those outcomes? I'm increasingly interested in the fields
          of cognitive health, neuroscience and (dare I say it) biohacking. I think there's a wealth of interesting ways
          you can experiment with the elements of your daily routine - and there's really no better time to try it than the
          present.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Robotics: I believe that human progress is defined by our ability to solve complex problems - from the very 
          earliest days, we built tools to help us accomplish tasks with less effort and time - thereby allowing us to 
          do even more with our limited time and energy. To me, intelligent automation marks the next step of this endeavour.
          I think intelligent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics">nature-inspired</a> robots will be 
          crucial for us to flourish in a changing world, and I'm really keen to learn more about the field.
