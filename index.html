      <h2>about me:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel. I've gone by many nicknames, but 'Emman' usually works.</p>
      <img src="/img/profile.jpg" alt="profile picture" height="400">
      <p>
        I am currently in my final year reading Computer Science at Singapore Management University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, asking hard questions, and tinkering. I'm looking to use my skills to work in
        high-impact roles tackling vital engineering problems in an open, collaborative context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an <a href="https://bigthink.com/progress/pessimism-is-a-barrier-to-progress/">impatient optimist</a>.
        I believe that creating a sustainable and equitable future is well within our means, and I want to see it
        happen in my lifetime. However, I know there's still a lot for me to learn, and I'd like to develop my
        expertise by working with the brightest people in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bulk of my interest and experience lies in backend development and system administration. I enjoy working
        with low-level languages like C and Java, but I am fluent with higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript
        as well. I have experience working with relational and document databases, cloud deployments, DevOps workflows,
        CI tooling and system design. As part of my course specialization in AI, I also have experience implementing
        data science workflows and machine learning models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Broadly, my career focus is on understanding low-level concepts and working with systems in order to
        build and maintain software that handles critical production loads. I'm actively looking out for roles that will
        help me build these skillsets (e.g. backend development, DevOps and SRE). I also believe in <a
          href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a>. Education, advocacy and community
        engagement are vitally important to me, and I actively share my knowledge through teaching and creating
        educational content online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my interests include strength training, nutrition and health science, <a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/londo_bells/?hl=en">model kits</a>, anime, jazz, and technical deep dives.

        A brief <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">summary</a> of what's going for me at the moment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Starting another semester at school - relatively light workload, but I'm working on a very interesting <a
            href="https://github.com/FYP-ScamSword">project</a> as a capstone module. Apart from this, I'm also learning
          about <a href="https://nusmods.com/modules/CS4215">programming language implementations</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Working on a part-time basis at <a href="https://www.fabrica.ai">Fabrica.AI</a>, implementing
          DevOps workflows (automated testing, builds and deployment, process visibility) and testing existing features
          on <a href="https://github.com/ros2/ros2">ROS</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Planning to embark on a research programme during my final semester, just to dip my toes into
          academia. Specifically, I'm interested in the implementation of formal methods in programming language design.
          One particularly interesting area is addressing the <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html">
            limitations</a> of compiled languages. In many regards, the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
          programming language was built to address these limitations, and I'm hoping that once I learn it properly, I
          can contribute to what's already been done in the <a href="https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/#project">RustBelt
            project</a>.

    <!-- Work -->
    <div id="work-content">
      <h2>work:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>Inspired by Den Delimarsky's '<a href="https://den.dev/how-i-work">How I work</a>'. Since work
        is becoming more flexible, asynchronous and project-based, I think it's useful to outline my own principles
        and expectations when working with others.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> - I usually work from mornings to the late afternoon (8am - 5pm), and leave time outside for creative
          pursuits. I find that I get the best work done in the morning, so I try to minimize communication during this
          period.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I like batching work together, and I often assign specific days of the week to work on a specific project
          or topic.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I generally prefer physical or face-to-face communication for first meetings and discussing
          ideas, but updates and clarifications can be done asynchronously on chats/task boards.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I strive to avoid repetitive back-and-forth. This means I often use pins, documentation, or calendar
          events for important information. The more comprehensive, the better.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - I don't expect instantaneous replies, but I would prefer receiving a response within 1 working day (which
          is a standard I hold myself to as well). Otherwise, a heads-up would be much appreciated.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> - Ask me questions! Give me feedback! I love input of any kind, as long as it's constructive. As a rule of
          thumb, I believe every single decision is open to criticism.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ul>

    <!-- Quotes -->
    <div id="quotes-content">
      <h2>quotes:<span class="cursor">|</span></h2>
      <p>
        As clich√©d as they may seem, I think <a href="http://quotes.cat-v.org/">quotes</a> serve as valuable reminders
        in daily life. Here are some of my personal favorites:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"What weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance
            requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Carlos Castaneda</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of
            being."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the
            sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction."</i> 
          <br> - <strong>The Bhagavad Gita (2:47)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own
            disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it,
            immediately or in the long run."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Practice yourself, for heaven's sake, in little things; and thence proceed to greater."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Epictetus</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Jiddu Krishnamurti</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without
            thinking of them."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Alfred North Whitehead</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"All cruelty stems from weakness."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Seneca</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Those who bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves."</i>
          <br> - <strong>J.M. Barrie</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a
            force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the
            world will not devote itself to making you happy."</i>
          <br> - <strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong,
            neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill, but
            time and chance happeneth to them all."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Ecclesiastes 9:11 (KJV)</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"The safest road to Hell is the gradual one ‚Äî the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings,
            without milestones, without signposts."</i>
          <br> - <strong>C.S. Lewis</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and
            whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be
            redeemed. Still life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes
            something happened better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely
            you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don't
            be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Mary Oliver</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."</i>
          <br> - <strong>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science
            crippled, thought and speculation at a standstill. Without books, the development of civilization would have
            been impossible. They are engines of change (as the poet said), windows on the world and lighthouses erected
            in the sea of time. They are companions, teachers, magicians, bankers of the treasures of the mind. Books
            are humanity in print."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Barbara Tuchman</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone
            gets busy on the proof."</i>
          <br> - <strong>John Kenneth Galbraith</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Charlie Chaplin</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I bargained with Life for a penny,
            <br>and Life would pay no more,
            <br>However I begged at evening
            <br>When I counted my scanty store;
            <br>
            <br>Life is a just employer.
            <br>He gives you what you ask,
            <br>But once you have set the wages,
            <br>Why, you must bear the task.
            <br>
            <br>I worked for a menial's hire,
            <br>Only to learn, dismayed,
            <br>That any wage I had asked of Life
            <br>Life would have willingly paid."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Jessie B. Rittenhouse</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"There is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average
            <br>Human being to supply any given army on any given day
            <br>And the best at murder are those who preach against it
            <br>And the best at hate are those who preach love
            <br>And the best at war finally are those who preach peace"</i>
          <br> - <strong>Charles Bukowski: The Genius Of The Crowd</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any
            religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth,
            being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any
            organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Jiddu Krishnamurti</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"We are not made for the mountains, for sunrises, or for the other beautiful attractions in life - those
            are simply intended to be moments of inspiration. We are made for the valley and the ordinary things of
            life and that is where we have to prove our stamina and strength."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Oswald Chambers</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Greek Proverb</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Edgar Allan Poe</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they
            are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact
            never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include
            greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people
            allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it
            is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here."</i>
          <br> - <strong>Richard Dawkins</strong>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>"Hey, it's our basic human right to be fuck ups. This civilisation is founded on fuck ups. And you know
            what? That makes me proud."</i>

      <p>
        Some of broad-themed questions and problems I'm mulling over - I'm hoping to work on at least a few of them once
        I've accumulated enough knowledge, resources and social connections:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Electronic Waste</strong>: Technology is enabling us to do much more than we were able to before, but
        there's one major issue - we haven't been able to close the loop with broken devices. There are many ways to
        mitigate this problem - by far, the easiest would be making hardware more modular and easy to repair, but beyond
        that, we urgently need to find methods to recycle the materials from broken hardware in a cost-efficient manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Public health</strong>: Implementing policies that target the low-hanging fruit and make the most impact
        for community-level health outcomes - I'm thinking of things like reducing noise and air pollution, expanding
        green spaces (see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U">solarpunk</a>), nutrition, sleep and
        pre-emptive health interventions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Cognition</strong>: There are many wicked problems in the world, and the truth is that they will only be
        solved by human ingenuity. How do we give ourselves the best shot at those outcomes? I'm increasingly interested
        in the fields of cognitive health, neuroscience and (dare I say it) biohacking. I think there's a wealth of
        interesting ways you can experiment with better living just by starting with the elements of your daily routine
        - and there's really no better time to try it than the present.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Robotics</strong>: I believe that human progress is defined by our ability to solve complex problems -
        from the very
        earliest days, we built tools to help us accomplish tasks with less effort and time - thereby allowing us to
        do even more with our limited time and energy. To me, intelligent automation marks the next step of this
        endeavour.
        We're probably a long way away, but I believe that <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics">nature-inspired</a> robots will be
        crucial for us to flourish in a changing world, and I'm really keen to learn more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Energy</strong>: Energy powers everything that we do. It's the foundation of modern society and our
        biggest challenge is to provide clean, reliable sources to meet humanity's needs as soon as possible.
        Technologies like solar and wind are in many cases already cheaper than fossil fuels, but we desperately need
        innovation in batteries to solve the problem of intermittency. I also think that nuclear power is a promising
        alternative that could play a much bigger role.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mental Health</strong>: Interest in mental health is growing at a stronger pace than ever, spurred by
        anxieties about the future, the breakneck pace of modern life, and the erosion of traditional communities and
        civic bonds. How do we prepare people - young and old - to thrive in this environment? How can we design
        policies, institutions and systems to be more humane? There are no easy answers when it comes to this, but if
        there's anything I know for sure, it's that change can only begin once we're able to have these conversations
        openly.
