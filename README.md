# Personal portfolio

Files for my personal portfolio site, hosted on Github Pages with html, css and vanilla JS as well as the [WinBox](https://github.com/nextapps-de/winbox) library.

## Built with

This site is built in vanilla html/css/js, but I used some tools (UglifyJS and minify) to reduce the size of the JS and CSS files to be served. The minified files can
be built with `npm build`
