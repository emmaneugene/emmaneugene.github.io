# Personal portfolio

Files for my personal portfolio site, hosted on Github Pages. 

## Built with

Written in HTML, CSS and vanilla JS as well as the [WinBox](https://github.com/nextapps-de/winbox) library.

I used some tools (UglifyJS and minify) to reduce the size of the JS and CSS files to be served. The minified files can
be built with `npm build` - but you will need to install the necessary dependencies to do so.
